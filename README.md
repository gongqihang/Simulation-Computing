# Simulation-Computing
Simulation of Physics Phenomena using Finite Difference Methods for Partial Differential Equations: RK4 Method implemented on Double Pendulums, Solitons etc

Solitons: Plots and antimates wave packets (solitons) colliding and interacting, with various boundary conditions and intial functions

Double Pendulums: Program that plots energy changes, amplitude changes as a function of time (simulation) for a simple chaotic system: the double pendulums
